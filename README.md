## Introduction to the Game

----------

The "Earth Defender" Game is a similar game to Defender, a Game released in 1980 in video arcades. 
When the game starts the player is shown a screen where they can select to start a game, they can select to view a help menu which will explain how to control the character they play as. They can also select an option that allows them to control the audio levels in the game. Finally the player can choose to exit the game.<br />
<br />
When the player chooses to start the game, the player controls a space ship that can move left and right, up and down on screen. The Player can fire Two beams from the front of their ship.
Enemy ships spawn from the top of the screen and can fire at the player. Each enemy has different stats, some of the enemies have different health stats. That means they can survive more hits from the player and some are able to move faster, making it harder for the player to hit them. There are 3 levels in the game, Each level ends when the player destroy a BOSS character that will show up in the game when the player has destroyed enough of the underlings. When each level is completed there is a transition level before the next level begins. On this transition screen the player can purchase upgrades with the points they have gained in the game. In this game the player can purchase one weapon upgrade in the form of a torpedo that does more damage than the beams that the player can choose to fire instead. Once unlocked, the player can switch between both the torpedo and the default beams as much as the player wishes.<br />
<br />
When the player character is destroyed losses a life. The player starts with 3 lives when the player has 0 lives and is destroyed the game ends. The player will be presented with a game over screen and can chose to start the game over again, the player will be brought back to the home screen where they can see the main menu options again. If the player completes all 3 levels and has lives remaining, they are shown an ending screen, where they can see their final score and can decide to start the game again.<br />
